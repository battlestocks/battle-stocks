## What is the vision of this product?

The vision of this product is to allow users to have the ability to invest and research stocks without the risk of using their own money.

What pain point does this project solve?

This solves the ability for people to practice stock trading with personal risk to their own money.

## Why should we care about your product?

The reason why our product is unique, but allows for people to make their own investment hypothesis based off historical analysis of charts and showcases the potential of investment opportunities.  

## In Scope:

One feature is to search up stock tickers to see and pull from yahoo finance (see current value).
Will showcase historical data of a given stock.
Allows user to navigate to seeing stocks in real time and using fake money to invest into stocks they think are worthwhile.
Give user the ability to add stocks into a portfolio to see data for their favorite stocks.

## Out of Scope

This will not be something that will become commercial use due to us using data from yahoo finance.
Will not convert to a real life money deposit account for actual stock trading.

## What will your MVP functionality be?

User will have the ability to look up a stock and be able to see the stock's pricing and show historical data within the last 5 years.

## What are your stretch goals?

Our stretch goals would be to implement a portfolio for the user to place their top 6 stocks in, add a money amount that could be used to purchase stocks and see how investments would go over a period of time, and give the user an ability to make an account.

## What stretch goals are you going to aim for?

We're aiming to have the ability to have a portfolio for the user and have the ability to have an account for each user.

## Functional Requirements

User can choose stock to see current market price.
User can also see the different historical data of a selected stock.
User will be able to change their preference stock within their portfolio.

## Data Slow

The user will Open up the application via console.
They will be allowed to login and then be greeted by a prompt that explains what they are using and how to use the application.  
They will then be able to start typing in a stock of their choosing to show a stock that they would like to purchase or sell.
They then will have the options to see the historical data via madplot charts.

## Non-Functional Requirements

With security -> We would want some type of user authentication to know that the user could come back and see their stocks listed out.
Testability -> With Testing there would be no known good way to test with the user they would need to interact with the console. Only way is if we were to test feature in a testing module later on.
